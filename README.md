# Lev-Tokens-Whitepaper-Draft

leveraged crypto tokens that don't suck!

## Key Premise - Current Leveraged Token Suck

Kucoin ETH3L, ADA3L- very high management fees charged _every day!_


# Built On An Efficient, Scalable Platform- Solana

cheap gas, fast transactions, realtime price updates



# A _REASONABLE_ Management Fee

KuCoin takes 0.045% **every day**...

On an apy basis, that's  1.00045 ^ 365 = 1.1785

Yes, that's right- KuCoin takes out a small amount every day which adds up to a 17.85% annual fee!! ðŸ¤¯

This is in our opinion, outrageous. It costs these exchanges close to nothing to run these smart contracts, and a 17.85% fee every year just completely fucks over the customer, in our opinion.

Some tokens such as the Gate.io "SOL3L" which tracks Solana, charges a slightly lower daily commission of 0.03%, although this still adds up to: 

1.0003 ^ 365 = 1.11570174905

Almost 12%!!

This is still in our opinion too much, and we're looking to be number 1 in the management fee category, setting the bar at 0.0002% daily, an apy of around 7.5% which is a LOT easier to swallow that 18%!!
